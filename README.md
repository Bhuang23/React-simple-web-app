# About the project

Hi, I am Brian Huang and this is my ecommerce app.
I designed and developed this web app from scratch using the MERN programming stack. 
This app allows users:
  ∙ sign up as user
  ∙ login in as user
  ∙ visit the ecommerce web app homepage
  ∙ view all items currently in stock
  ∙ search items of a certain category
  ∙ checkout items and buy them
